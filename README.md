_**Introduction**_  
Welcome to our web design project, which we envision will serve the purpose of building a website promoting the commercial space tourism startup - "Aurora Ireland".  

"Aurora Ireland" is being launched with the aim of joining the new frontier of affordable private space travel, and the company website will reflect that ambition.   

The basic function of the website will be to attract interest from prospective space travellers, so appearance and functionality will be crucial to meet that objective. Therefore we will focus on content which can immediately grab the attention of site visitors, but also want to have crisp, clear site navigation.  

_**Research**_
In the course of our research, we have identified 3 key competitors in our field, namely:

[SpaceX](www.spacex.com)  
SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft.  

[Virgin Galactic](www.virgingalactic.com)  
The world's first commercial spaceline.  

[Blue Origin](www.blueorigin.com)  
Developing ground-breaking spaceflight systems.  

All of these sites make heavy use of video and photographic content, using simple navbar styles in the case of two and 'burger' menu on another.


_**Overview of the Site**_  
It has a Space theme.

**Production Details**  
Work Split, how well we worked as a team...etc  
We kept a [Project Blog]().

Our initial approach to developing the project includes wireframing and building a sitemap, having decided as a team on the proposed basic layout of the site. Once we assign tasks amongst the team and begin to write code, we will utilise Git and Github to maintain version control whilst sharing code.  


**Requirements Gathering**  

**Highlights of JS/CSS etc.**
