**DRAFT** - Project Report part 1

Project Overview
_____________________________________

** This section should introduce your website, outlining the early ideas or plans you have for your project and the scope of what you wish to achieve at this stage in development. **


Welcome to our web design project, which we envision will serve the purpose of building a website promoting the commercial space tourism startup 
- "????COMPANY-NAME????"

"????COMPANY-NAME????" is being launched with the aim of joining the new frontier of affordable private space travel, and the company website will reflect that ambition. 

The basic function of the website will be to attract interest from prospective space travellers, so appearance and functionality will be crucial to meet that objective. Therefore we will focus on content which can immediately grab the attention of site visitors, but also want to have crisp, clear site navigation.

Research / Investigation
_____________________________________

** NOTE: You should look at a minimum of 3 competitors, giving details of which companies you looked at.
This section should give details of all research carried out. What other types of websites are online targeted at your market? What do you like/dislike about these sites? How can your team better approach your own webite, having looked at the competitors. What ideas/concepts came from the research? Etc. **



In the course of our research, we have identified 3 key competitors in our field, namely:

SpaceX
(www.spacex.com)
SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft.

Virgin Galactic - the world's first commercial spaceline (www.virgingalactic.com)

Blue Origin - developing ground-breaking spaceflight systems. (www.blueorigin.com)

All of these sites make heavy use of video and photographic content, using simple navbar styles in the case of two and 'burger' menu on another.

Requirements & Technical Approach
_____________________________________

** This section should outline what requirements that project has and how you initially plan to approach project development, taking these requirements into consideration. **


As per the Web Design Project Specification, this project's requirements include:

•	Site should have a minimum of 5 HTML pages (one page to include a HTML form)
•	Site styling controlled by at least one external CSS file 
•	Clearly defined, consistent, navigation system 
•	Website must be responsive 
•	Use of JavaScript (minimum 4 examples) 
•	Website Deployment 

Our initial approach to developing the project includes wireframing and building a sitemap, having decided as a team on the proposed basic layout of the site.
Once we assign tasks amongst the team and begin to write code, we will utilise Git and Github to maintain version control whilst sharing code.
