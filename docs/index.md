### :white_check_mark: Validator 2: Judgement Day
**@hanlonmk1** ran our first pass at html and css validation. Except for a few missing _ALT_ text on images we are in good shape. Whoohoo!

### :last_quarter_moon_with_face: Late Late Show
We are working late again tonight to try and get things finished. We are realising that we didn't plan well enough. All the things we wanted to get into the project won't happen now because we need to get our project report.

### :ambulance: GitHub to the Rescue
Looks like it will be late nights all this week to get everything finished. Good progress this evening with some issues fixed and making use of ![GitHub Issues](https://github.com/oneillal/nci-web-project/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) to track things that we need to address. Pity we didn't think of this earlier. Would have helped a lot.

### :warning: Responsive? Ugh!
The responsive design is proving to be a big challenge. We are struggling trying to make our design work on a mobile view. We had to simplfy the page layout because we don't have the time now to figure out how to get it all into a mobile view that works. Lesson learned...make sure your design will work for both Desktop and Mobile.

### :sparkles: All Day, All Night
We all took a study day today and booked a meeting room for an all-day working session that turn into an all night session. We made a lot of good progress. Took quiet a while to try and realise the wireframe with actual HTML and CSS but we managed to get something that looks pretty close.
We start out with this...

### :electric_plug: We are Wired!!
Finally settling on how we wanted our pages to look so created draft basic wireframes. Could not get Balsamiq to install so just put them together in good ole' Visio. We are planning an all day session during Easter week so hopefully we can make some good progress.

## :rage1: Creative Differences
Still struggling with ideas for our website. **@oneillal** idea for a kayaking tour company isn't going down well with creative director **@hanlonmk1**.
