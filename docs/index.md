## Project Report 

### _12th April 2017_  
We all took a study day today and booked a meeting room for an all-day working session. We made a lot of good progress. Took quiet a while to try and realise the wireframe with actual HTML and CSS but we managed to get something that looks pretty close.
We start out with this...

### _5th April 2017_  
Finally settling on how we wanted our pages to look so created draft basic wireframes. Could not get Balsamiq to install so just put them together in good ole' Visio. We are planning an all day session during Easter week so hopefully we can make some good progress.
